sugarcrm-custom-quote-line-items
================================

illustrates how to add custom fields to a quote...Readme provides to diff's which have been marked up.


###Notes:
- I first imported the original files from my sugarcrm instance so that I could commit my changes and they could be viewed in diff format.
- It's possible that I may have made some changes to these core files prior to today.  So, it's a good idea to not blindly overwrite your files.
- For the javascript files, on my instance they were minified.  I "beautified" them using this website: http://jsbeautifier.org/

- Note: I didn't copy to custom folder so this is not upgrade safe.  You probably will want to do this.  See these posts:
