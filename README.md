sugarcrm-custom-quote-line-items
================================

Illustrates how to add custom fields to a quote line item.  I added to github so you could view a marked up diff of the changes made.

Also, I'd recommend looking at [this blog](http://blog.sssworld.com/2013/10/25/customizing-line-item-in-sugarcrm-in-upgrade-safe-manner/) article:
It walks you through how to make these changes in an upgrade safe manner and provides more commentary.
But, doesn't show how to add a "custom" field (just a standard field that isn't normally there).


### Notes:
- For the javascript files, on my instance they were minified.  I "beautified" them using this website: http://jsbeautifier.org/
- It's possible that I may have made some changes to these core files prior to today.  So, it's a good idea to not blindly overwrite your files.

- Note: I didn't copy to custom folder so this is not upgrade safe.  You probably will want to do this.  See these posts:
